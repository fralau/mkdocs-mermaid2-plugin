# mkdocs-mermaid2-plugin

An [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) plugin that renders textual graph
descriptions into [Mermaid](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid) graphs
(flow charts, sequence diagrams, pie charts, etc.).




> This is a fork from
> [Pugong Liu's excellent project](https://github.com/pugong/mkdocs-mermaid-plugin), 
> which is no longer maintained. It offers expanded documentation as
> well as new functions.

## How it works
This plugin transfers the Mermaid code (text) describing the diagram 
into the final HTML page:

    <div class="mermaid">
    ...
    <\div>

It also inserts a call to the 
[javascript library](https://github.com/mermaid-js/mermaid) :

    <script>
    mermaid.initialize(...)
    </script>

To interpret that code it needs a call to the Mermaid library:
```javascript
<script src="https://unpkg.com/mermaid/dist/mermaid.min.js">
</script>
```

The user's browser will then read this code and render it on the fly.

> No svg/png images are harmed during the rendering of that graph.



## Installation

### Automatic


```bash
pip install mkdocs-mermaid2-plugin
```

### Manual
Clone this repository in a local directory and install the package:

```bash
python setup.py install
```

## Configuration

### Basic Steps
To enable this plugin, you need to declare it in your config file
(`mkdocs.yml`).

In order to work, the plugin also requires the
[mermaid](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mermaid) javascript
library (in the exemple below, it fetched from the last version
from the [unpkg](https://unpkg.com/) repository; change the version
no as needed).

```yaml
plugins:
    - search
    - mermaid2
```

### Specification of the version of the Mermaid library
> **For plugin version >= 0.4**

By default, the plugin selects a version of the Mermaid javascript library
that is known to work (some versions work better than others).

You may specify a different version of the Mermaid library, like so:

```yaml
plugins:
  - search
  - mermaid2:
      version: 8.6.0
```

### Explicit declaration of the Mermaid library
> If you use a version of the plugin >= 0.4, the basic steps are sufficient.

You _may_ specify the mermaid library explicitly, as long as it is
call mermaid (independently of extension):

```yaml
extra_javascript:
    - https://unpkg.com/mermaid@8.7.0/dist/mermaid.min.js
```

For the latest version:

```yaml
extra_javascript:
    - https://unpkg.com/mermaid/dist/mermaid.min.js
```


> **Note for plugin version < 0.4:** You **must*** include the mermaid.min.js (local or remotely) in your `mkdocs.yml`. If you want to be on the safe side, you may want to specify a version that you know is working for you, e.g. `https://unpkg.com/mermaid@8.7.0/dist/mermaid.min.js` 

> **Note:**  If you declare plugins you need to declare _all_ of them, 
> including `search` (which would otherwise have been installed by default.)


## Usage

### General Principle
In order to insert a Mermaid diagram in a markdown page, simply 
type it using the mermaid syntax,
and surround it with the code fence for Mermaid:


    ```mermaid
    graph TD
    A[Client] --> B[Load Balancer]
    B --> C[Server01]
    B --> D[Server02]
    ```

### How to write Mermaid diagrams
* For instructions on how to make a diagram, see 
  [the official website](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/).
* If you are not familiar, see the [n00bs' introduction to mermaid](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/n00b-overview).
* In case of doubt, you will want to test your diagrams in the
  [Mermaid Live Editor](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid-live-editor).

### Read from .mmd files

Sometimes mermaid diagrams can get quite large and having them inline with your main markdown doc can make it hard to manage. If you prefer to keep your diagrams in seperate `.mmd` files, you can put the file path to your `.mmd` file where you would like to insert the diagram.

#### Example

If you have have a file `my_diagram.mmd` in a `diagrams` directory inside your `docs` directory
> **Note:** The search path is inside of the `docs_dir` for your config, so be sure you path is relative to that which is `docs` by default.

```markdown
# My Markdown file

`diagrams/my_diagram.mmd`

```

The `diagrams/my_diagram.mmd` will be replaced in the build with the contents of the file.

> **Note:** Don't use the mermaid code block tags inside the mmd file. The plugin with do this automatically for you.


### Adding arguments to the Mermaid engine

By default, the plugin automatically inserts 
the a Javascript command `mermaid.initialize();`
in the HTML pages, which starts the interpretation.
Sometimes, however, you may want to add some
initialization commands (see [full list](https://github.com/knsv/mermaid/blob/master/docs/mermaidAPI.md#mermaidapi-configuration-defaults)).

For example, you could change the theme of the diagram, 
using 'dark' instead of the default one. 
Simply add those arguments in the config file, e.g.

```yaml
plugins:
    - search
    - mermaid2:
        arguments:
          theme: 'dark'


extra_javascript:
    - https://unpkg.com/mermaid/dist/mermaid.min.js
```

### Testing

To test your website with a diagram, restart the mkdocs server:

    mkdocs serve

In your browser, open the webpage on the localhost
(by default: `https://localhost:8000`)


### Adding a Javascript callback function

_New in 0.3.0_

#### Use Case
To make modifications that are not possible with css, it can be useful
to insert a callback function (Javascript) into the target HTML page.

This can be done using the standard pattern, e.g.:

```javascript
<script src="js/extra.js">
<script>mermaid.initialize({
    theme: "dark",
    mermaid: {
        callback: myMermaidCallbackFunction
    }
});</script>
```

In this case, `myMermaidCallbackFunction`is located in
the `js/extra.js` on the site's root directory. 

Here is a simplistic example:

```
// js/extra.js
function myMermaidCallbackFunction(id) {
  console.log('myMermaidCallbackFunction', id);
```

> You will see the results if you display the browser's console.

#### Method
This can be translated into the config (`mkdocs.yaml`) file as:

```yaml
plugins:
  - mermaid2:
      arguments:
        theme: dark
        mermaid:
            callback: ^myMermaidCallbackFunction

extra_javascript:
  - https://unpkg.com/mermaid/dist/mermaid.min.js
  - js/extra.js
```

1. Note that **the name of the function must be preceded by a ^ (caret)**
   to signify it's a literal and not a string.
2. Consider the **directory path** for the script
   as **relative to the document directory** (`docs`).
   Mkdocs will then put it in the proper place in the hierarchy of the
   html pages.

## Tips and Tricks

### Setting the security level to "loose"

To access these functions, you need to relax mermaid's security level,
([since version 8.2](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/?id=special-note-regarding-version-82)).

> This requires, of course, your application taking responsibility 
> for the security of the diagram source.

If that is OK with you, you can set the argument in the configuration of the
plugin:

```yaml
    - mermaid2:
        arguments:
          securityLevel: 'loose'
```

### Formating text in diagrams
> To enable this function, you need to [relax mermaid's security level to 'loose'](#setting-the-security-level-to-loose).

You may use HTML in the diagram.

> **Note:** This is guaranteed to work with Mermaid 8.6.4, but
> does not work e.g. on 8.7.0.


```mermaid
graph LR
    hello["<b>Hello</b>"] --> world["<big><i>World</i></big>"]
    world --> mermaid[mermaid web site]
```

Use this in the config file:
```yaml
extra_javascript:
     - https://unpkg.com/mermaid@8.6.4/dist/mermaid.min.js
```



### Adding Hyperlinks to a Diagram (versions of Mermaid >~ 8.5.0)

> To enable this function, you need to [relax mermaid's security level to 'loose'](#setting-the-security-level-to-loose).

Use the click directive in the language (for more information,
see [Interaction](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/flowchart?id=interaction) on the official mermaid website).

```mermaid
graph LR
    hello --> world
    world --> mermaid[mermaid web site]
    click mermaid "https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid" "Website"
```



### Adding Hyperlinks to a Diagram (versions of Mermaid <~ 8.5.0)
> To enable this function, you need to [relax mermaid's security level to 'loose'](#setting-the-security-level-to-loose).

It is possible to add hyperlinks to a  diagram, e.g.:

```
box1[An <b>important</b> <a href="http://google.com">link</a>] 
```




## Compatibility

### List
Here is a short list of comptabilities and incompatibilities for
the mermaid plugin:

Item | Type | Status | Note 
--|--|--|--
**admonition** | extension | YES | 
**footnotes** | extension | YES | 
**minify** | plugin | NO | Breaks the mermaid diagrams.
**pymdownx.highlight** | extension | NO | Use [pymdownx.superfences](#declaring-the-superfences-extension)
**pymdownx.superfences** | extension | OK | [see paragraph](#declaring-the-superfences-extension)
**search** | plugin | OK | Do not forget to declare it in `config.yml`.


### Using Mermaid and code highlighting at the same time

#### Usage

It is quite natural that we want to display **mermaid diagrams**,
while having usual **code highlighting** (for bash, python, etc.).

#### Use of markdown extensions
**Symptom**: The mermaid code is not transformed into a diagram,
but processed as code to be displayed (colors, etc.).


The likely reason is that you have a markdown extension that interprets
all fenced code as code to display, and it prevents the mkdocs-mermaid2
plugin from doing its job.

**Do not use the [codehilite](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/extensions/codehilite/) markdown extension.**

Instead, use [facelessusers](https://github.com/facelessuser)'s splendid 
[PyMdown's superfences](https://facelessuser.github.io/pymdown-extensions/extensions/superfences/); and use the 
**[custom fences](https://facelessuser.github.io/pymdown-extensions/extensions/superfences/#custom-fences)**
facility.


#### Declaring the superfences extension
In the config file (`mkdocs.yaml`):

```yaml
markdown_extensions:
  - pymdownx.superfences:
      # make exceptions to highlighting of code:
      custom_fences:
        - name: mermaid
          class: mermaid
          format: !!python/name:mermaid2.fence_mermaid
```

It means: 

1. Take the fenced parts marked with mermaid
2. Turn them into `class='mermaid'`.
3. To format those pieces, use the function `fence_mermaid`, 
   from the mermaid2 package.


> **IMPORTANT:** Note that the superfences will be slightly more demanding with
> HTML tags inside a mermaid diagram: 
> **take care to always close the HTML tags that require it**
> (e.g. `<small>` must have its corresponding `</small>` tag).
> Otherwise, the extension system will attempt to close those tags 
> and it will break the diagram.






## Troubleshooting: the mermaid diagram is not being displayed

> To start with, use a simple diagram that you know is syntactically correct.

e.g.

    ```mermaid
    graph TD
    A[Client] --> B[Load Balancer]
    B --> C[Server01]
    B --> D[Server02]
    ```



### Is mkdocs' version up to date (>= 1.1) ?

Use `mkdocs -v`.

If not, update it:

    pip install mkdocs --upgrade

Or, if you cloned this repo:

    python setup.py install


### Is the javascript library properly called?

In order to work, the proper javascript library must called from
the html page.

The configuration file (`mkdocs.yml`) should contain the following line:

    extra_javascript:
        - https://unpkg.com/mermaid/dist/mermaid.min.js




### Is the diagram syntactically correct?

In recent versions of the javascript library (> 8.6.0), a pretty
error message is displayed in case of incorrect syntax:

![error message](error.png)

> **In earlier versions, the library displays nothing, which 
> can be confusing.**



Every diagram should start with a valid preamble, e.g. `graph TD`.

In case of doubt, you may want to test your diagram in the
[Mermaid Live Editor](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid-live-editor).


> Note, however, that the Mermaid Live Editor **does not
> support loose mode** (with HTML code in the mermaid code).


### Is the diagram correctly fenced?

In the markdown document, a mermaid diagram should be preceded by:
    
    ```mermaid

    It should be followed by:

    ```
    ```

## Using the mermaid2.dumps() function

As a bonus, mermaid2 exports the function `dumps()` which produces a string
describing a [JavaScript object](https://javascript.info/object).
It can be used to help generate JavaScript code from Python
(this is typically needed, when generating an HTML page that contains
JavaScript).

A JavaScript object is not exactly the same as a JSON object.
The reason why this why introduced is that sometimes one needs to produce
a key/value pair as:

```JavaScript
foo = MyFunctioName
```

where the value is _not_ a string but an identifier (in this case:
a function name).

Here is an example:

```python
import mermaid2

obj = { "hello": "world", 
    "barbaz": "^bazbar",
    "foo": {"bar": 2},
    "bar": True}

s = mermaid2.dumps(obj)

```

The purpose of the caret is to specify that the value should be
an identifier and not a string. The result will be:

```JavasScript
{
    hello: "world",
    barbaz: bazbar,
    foo: {
        bar: 2
    },
    bar: true
}
```
